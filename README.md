## Vanilla Node API Build

This assignment was a bit of a bear. I really took my time going through the build in lab while I listened along again with the lecture. It took me a long time to track down an error that was actually occurring in my JSON body parser module. I realized after a lot of banging my head against the wall that I had forgotten the return statement before the resolve call. You never really get something until you do it though, right. I definitely felt a switch turn tonight while trying desperately to debug that I will be using gulp more thoroughly for testing purposes from now on. I started out well today but got ahead of myself and it really bit me in the butt. Good lesson to learn!
